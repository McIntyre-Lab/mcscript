# McIntyre Library
This is a set of simple classes to handle various types of 
genomic/transcriptomic data. Some of these classes are simple wrappers for 
other python modules such as `gffutils`. In order to use these classes various 
python modules will need to be installed. Check the import statements at the 
top of the script to determine dependencies. 

For more detailed information about this library please see [McIntyre Library
