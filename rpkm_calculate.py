    description="""This script can be used to calculates coverage (RPKM and APN) in two different settings:\n
    (1) Coverage can be calculated across an entire genomic region. To do
        this a 3-column bed file must be provided (Try fasta2bed.py). 
        col[0] = chromosome/fusion name (eg., chr2L or S7_SI)
        col[1] = start position (i.e., '0') 
        col[2] = end position (i.e., length) 

    (2) Coverage can also be calculated by excising specific exons/fusions
        from a genome. For example if you have aligned to the genome, but want
        coverage at the exon level. For this a 4-column bed must be provided.
        col[0] = chromosome name (eg., chr2L)
        col[1] = exon/fusion start position (eg., 2929)
        col[2] = exon/fusion end position (eg., 3090)
        col[3] = exon/fusion name (eg., S7_SI) 
        IMPORTANT: Setting 2 requires a lot of RAM ~10-12GB for calculating
        coverage using fly fusions """
